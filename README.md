# Planetary Calculator App

A simple planetary calculator app for viewing orbital information and calculating perihelion (furthest orbit from the star) differences in perihelion between planets.

## Features
- **Menu-based Input**: Retrieve planetary data and calculate distances in AU (Astronomical Units).
- **Distance Conversion**: Converts AU values to kilometers for easier interpretation.

## Purpose
This project is part of my learning journey in Python. I recently completed topics like lists, dictionaries, and tuples. This project explores:
- Basic input validation
- Dictionary handling
- Simple calculations

## Challenges
The project presented several challenges, particularly in understanding how local and global variables work. Resolving these issues gave me a clearer grasp of variable scope and program flow.

## Future Plans
Once I learn more about data science, I plan to update this project with data manipulation features, making it more robust and feature-rich.
